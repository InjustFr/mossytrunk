# Discounts

A discount rule is a set of **conditions** (all must be met by the basket) and one **action** applied to the items those conditions pick.
Example: « 2 prints et 1 sticker pour 15 € » → conditions `2 × type Print` and `1 × type Sticker`, action `fixed price 15 €`.
A condition can offer **several targets**: « 3 prints Mossy ou Évoli : −2 € » → condition `3 × (product Mossy fauna Print 15x15 or product Eevee Print 8x8)`, action `amount off 2 €`; any mix of the listed products makes the 3 units.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `name` | Label shown on orders (e.g. « 2 prints et 1 sticker pour 15 € ») |
| `conditions` | One or more `quantity × targets`: the quantity is picked among the units matching **any** of the condition's targets. A target is a **product type** (every product of that type, including products created later), a **type · variant** (« Print · A3 »: every A3 print), a **product** (any of its variants) or a **product · variant** (« Print Forêt · A3 ») |
| `action` | `fixedPrice` — the picked items cost this price together · `amountOff` — this amount is taken off the picked items · `percentOff` — this percentage (basis points, 1000 = 10 %) is taken off the picked items |
| `startsOn` / `endsOn` | Optional validity period, whole days (Europe/Paris), both bounds included. Empty = no limit on that side |
| status | Derived from the dates only: « En cours » (today within the period, or no dates), « À venir », « Expirée » |

Model: `src/Domain/Discount/DiscountRule.php`, `DiscountCondition.php` (quantity + targets), `ConditionTarget.php` (`ProductTarget`, `TypeTarget`), `DiscountAction.php`, `ValidityPeriod.php`, `DiscountCalculator.php`, `AppliedDiscount.php`, `BasketLine.php`.

## Rules

| # | Rule | Where | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Name required, ≥ 1 condition, each condition on ≥ 1 unit and ≥ 1 target, a target appears once in the whole rule (in one condition, once); action value > 0 and a percentage ≤ 100 %; the period's end is not before its start | `DiscountRule::redefine()`, `DiscountCondition`, `DiscountAction`, `ValidityPeriod::between()` | `DiscountRuleTest`, `DiscountActionTest` |
| D1b | A unit matches a product target when it is that product, a type target when its product has that type; a target with a variant also needs the unit's variant to be that one (case-insensitive). A unit matches a condition when it matches **one of its targets**. The variant must exist on the type / product. A target appears once per variant (« Print » and « Print · A3 » can coexist) | `DiscountCondition::matches()`, `ConditionTarget::matches()`; the type and variant travel in `SellableItem`/`BasketLine` | `DiscountCalculatorTest`, `DiscountRuleTest` |
| D2 | Discounts are **applied automatically** when an order is placed manually; the user never picks them. A rule applies when the order's date (not today's) is within its period | `DiscountCalculator::calculate()` called by `OrderPricing` (`PlaceOrderHandler`, `PreviewOrderHandler`, `ImportSalesHandler`), `DiscountRule::appliesOn()` | `DiscountCalculatorTest`, `DiscountRuleUseCasesTest` |
| D3 | Each condition picks its `quantity` **most expensive** still-free matching units; **most specific conditions pick first**: product · variant, then product, then type · variant, then type (so « 1 Holo + 1 sticker » keeps the other sticker for the type condition); a condition with several targets is as specific as its broadest target. A missing unit → the rule does not apply | `DiscountCalculator::take()`, `DiscountRule::conditionsMostSpecificFirst()`, `DiscountCondition::specificity()` | `DiscountCalculatorTest` |
| D4 | Saving of an application: fixed price → normal price of the picked units − price; amount off → the amount, at most the normal price; percent off → normal price × percentage, rounded to the cent. Applied only if the saving is positive | `DiscountAction::saving()`, `DiscountCalculator` | `DiscountActionTest`, `DiscountCalculatorTest` |
| D5 | **Several discounts can apply to one order.** Selection is greedy: the application with the **biggest saving** is applied first, its units are removed, and the search starts again on the remaining units — possibly with the same rule again, or another one. Ties broken by rule name | `DiscountCalculator::calculate()` | `DiscountCalculatorTest` |
| D6 | Each unit is used by at most one application. Several applications of the same rule are grouped on the order as one line « name ×n » | `DiscountCalculator::calculate()` | `DiscountCalculatorTest` |
| D7 | Orders store a **snapshot** (label + amount) of applied discounts, plus the rule's id to link to it: editing, stopping or deleting a rule never changes past orders | `Order::appliedDiscounts`, `AppliedDiscount::ruleId` | `OrderTest` |
| D8 | Orders imported at the day's market get the rules valid on their date only when they explain the service's discount (to within 2 cents), otherwise « Remise {service} » (see [imports.md](imports.md) I8, S8) | `Order::imported()`, `ImportSalesHandler` | `OrderTest`, `ImportSumUpSalesTest`, `ImportPoliciesTest` |
| D9 | There is no on/off flag: the switch rewrites the dates. Stopping a running rule ends it **yesterday** (refused when it started today: edit or delete it instead); starting an upcoming rule moves its start to **today**. An expired rule has no switch and cannot be started: edit its dates to reuse it. Rules switched off before this rule existed were given an end date of the day before the change | `DiscountRule::startOn()`, `stopBefore()`, `ValidityPeriod::statusOn()` | `DiscountRuleTest`, `DiscountRuleUseCasesTest` |
| D10 | Deleting, moving or merging a product or type shrinks the conditions that list it: its targets are removed (or retargeted onto the product it moves to, merged with a condition already on it), a condition left without target disappears, and a rule left without condition is refused (OnlyEligibleProduct / OnlyEligibleType) | `DiscountRule::replaceProduct()`, `withdrawProduct()`, `withdrawType()`, `withdrawEveryProduct()` | `DiscountRuleTest` |

### Worked example: 2 prints + 1 sticker

Print 15 €, sticker 4 €. Basket: 2 prints + 1 sticker (34 € without discount).
- « 2 prints et 1 sticker pour 15 € » (2 × Print, 1 × Sticker, fixed price 15 €) → saving 19 € → **15 €**.
- Basket of 5 prints + 2 stickers with the same rule → applied twice (« ×2 », saving 38 €), the fifth print stays at full price.
- With also « 3 stickers pour 10 € » active and a basket of 2 prints + 4 stickers: the prints rule saves more, so it takes 2 prints and the most expensive sticker; the 3 other stickers form a « 3 stickers pour 10 € » → both discounts on the order.

## Use cases & API

Create `POST /api/discount-rules` `{name, conditions: [{quantity, targets: [{kind: product|type, id, variant?}]}], action: {kind: fixedPrice|amountOff|percentOff, value}, startsOn?, endsOn?}` (value in cents, or basis points for a percentage; dates `YYYY-MM-DD` or null) · Update `PUT /api/discount-rules/{id}` · Start today / stop (ends yesterday) `PUT` / `DELETE /api/discount-rules/{id}/activation` · Delete `DELETE /api/discount-rules/{id}` · List `GET /api/discount-rules` (each target comes back with its `name`).

UI: `/discounts` — two sections, « En cours et à venir » and « Passées » (expired rules, most recently ended first). Each rule shows its conditions as chips (quantity, then each target — type colour, name, variant — separated by « ou ») leading to the action (« 2 × Print + 1 × Sticker → pour 15,00 € »), its period, normal price at the selling prices **of the rule's days** — its last day once expired, its first day when it has not started, today otherwise, read in each product's price history (« prix du … » shown when not today; a range when a type's products differ) and the customer's saving, a switch labelled « En cours » / « À venir » (none once expired), edit and two-step delete. Form: conditions (quantity, then one or more targets — Type / Produit, combobox, variant — added with « Ajouter un produit ou un type »), action (Prix fixe / Remise en € / Remise en %), normal and customer price hint (same days as the list), optional « Valable du » / « Au » dates. `/discounts?remise=<id>` opens that rule; a rule discount on an order's detail page links there.
